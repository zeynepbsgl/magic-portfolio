## Project Overview

Zirve Deri is a "Production-Grade" software project developed to break free from the limitations of standard off-the-shelf e-commerce packages and provide a completely brand-specific experience.

This project is not just a product sales site; it is an integrated system designed with every detail in mind, from stock management to payment security, and from cargo tracking to the design of emails sent to customers.

### 1. Modern UI & User Experience (Frontend)

**React** and **TypeScript** technologies were used to provide users with a fast and fluid shopping experience without leaving the site.

* **Responsive Design:** A modern interface coded with a "Mobile-First" approach that looks flawless on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Fast Navigation:** Ability to switch between products without refreshing the page (SPA - Single Page Application).
* **Dynamic Filtering:** An instant filtering system that allows users to find what they are looking for among hundreds of leather products by size, color, and category within seconds.

---

### 2. Complex Variant Management

The biggest technical challenge in leather goods (belts, wallets, etc.) is having multiple variations of a single product (e.g., 110cm Black, 120cm Brown).

* **Database Architecture:** By establishing "One-to-Many" relationships in the relational database (MSSQL), the stock of each variant was made trackable individually.
* **Stock Control:** When a customer selects a 110cm belt, the system checks the stock of only that variant in the background. If the stock is out, the "Add to Cart" button is automatically disabled.

### 3. Secure Payment Infrastructure with PayTR

Full integration was achieved with **PayTR**, one of Turkey's leading payment institutions, for the security of financial transactions.

* **iFrame Integration:** Credit card information is not stored on our server; it is processed directly through PayTR's secure iFrame structure (PCI-DSS compliance).
* **Callback (Webhook) Validation:** When the "success" signal is received from PayTR upon completion of the payment, a hash validation (token validation) is performed in the background to verify the transaction, and the order is created only after this security step.

---

### 4. Cargo Integration and Operational Management

The process from receiving the order to delivering it to the customer is managed through a specially developed **Admin Panel**.

* **Cargo Tracking Integration:** When the order is shipped, the tracking number entered from the admin panel is processed into the system.
* **Order Status Management:** Statuses such as "Preparing", "Shipped", and "Delivered" are updated by the administrator, and these updates are instantly reflected on the customer's profile page.

---

### 5. Modern HTML Email Notifications

Professional **HTML Templates** were used instead of ordinary text messages to prevent emails sent to customers from falling into spam and to ensure a corporate look.

* **Automatic Triggers:**
    * **Order Confirmation:** As soon as payment is received, a stylish email containing the order summary and product images is sent to the customer.
    * **Cargo Notification:** When the product is shipped, an information email containing the tracking link is automatically sent.
* **Technology:** Using the `MailKit` library on the backend and a dynamic HTML render engine, personalized content (e.g., Dear [Customer Name]) is generated.
